; => when input grows by factor of ten, number of steps seems to grow by factor of Ìƒ2
                                        ; => logarithmic growth of steps

; mathematical answer (found online): since angle a is divided by 3 each time procedure p is applied, p is applied once for each complete power of 3 contained within the angle a, ceiling is base 3 logarithm divided by 0.1
